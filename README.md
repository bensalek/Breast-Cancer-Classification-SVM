Breat Cancer Classification- SVM

Breast cancer the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases and affected 2.1 million people in 2015. Early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival. The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign. machine learning techniques can dramatically improves the accuracy of diagnosis.

Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while 91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques.

The purpose of this project is to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features from several cell images. Benign means that the tumor is kind of not spreading across the bodies of the patient is safe somehow. If it's malignant that means it's a cancerous.
I have extracted 30 characteristics out of the image such as texture perimeter, area, smoothness and so on. Then I feed all these features into the  machine learning model.

This is a supervised machine learning project and I used SVM model to classify the images to benign and malignant.
